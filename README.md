# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bradley

I'm an aspiring full-stack software developer currently training at Northcoders, learning JavaScript, Node.js, React, and SQL.

Before tech, I worked in care and support roles, where I developed strong communication and problem-solving skills under pressure. After starting life-changing treatment in 2022, Iâ€™ve been rebuilding from the ground up â€” and now Iâ€™m fully focused on launching a career in software development.

## ðŸ”§ Tech I'm Learning
- JavaScript (ES6+), Node.js
- Test-Driven Development (Jest, Supertest)
- SQL, Express, APIs
- React, HTML, CSS
- Git & GitHub, Agile workflows, pair programming

## ðŸ“Œ Projects Coming Soon
Solo projects will be added during and after bootcamp â€“ each with a clear README and live demo where possible.
